description: |-
  Terraform module for AWS IAM Access Analyzer setup with support for organization-wide analysis, 
  delegated administration, and customizable archive rules. Enables security assessment of resource 
  access across AWS accounts and organizations.

# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-
  This Terraform module provides a comprehensive solution for setting up AWS IAM Access Analyzer
  in your AWS environment. It supports both account-level and organization-wide analyzers, with
  features including delegated administration setup and configurable archive rules. The module
  helps identify resources shared with external entities and manage unused access patterns.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  # Terragrunt example configuration (terragrunt.hcl):
  ```hcl
  include "root" {
    path = find_in_parent_folders()
  }

  terraform {
    source = "git::https://github.com/cloudopsworks/terraform-module-aws-iam-access-analyzer-setup.git?ref=v1.0.0"
  }

  inputs = {
    settings = {
      organization = {
        enabled = true
        delegated = true
        account_id = "123456789012"
      }
      analyzer_type = "ORGANIZATION"
      archive_rules = {
        public_access = {
          filters = [
            {
              criteria = "resourceType"
              eq = ["AWS::S3::Bucket"]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

# Example usage
examples: |-
  # Account-level analyzer
  ```yaml
  settings:
    analyzer_enabled: true
    analyzer_type: "ACCOUNT"
  ```

  # Organization-wide analyzer with delegated admin
  ```yaml
  settings:
    organization:
      enabled: true
      delegated: true
      account_id: "123456789012"
    analyzer_type: "ORGANIZATION"
  ```

  # Analyzer with archive rules
  ```yaml
  settings:
    analyzer_enabled: true
    archive_rules:
      unused_access:
        filters:
          - criteria: "resourceType"
            eq: ["AWS::IAM::Role"]
          - criteria: "lastAuthenticatedTime"
            exists: true
  ```
